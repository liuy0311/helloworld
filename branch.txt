# This document will describe how to do branching and merging with branches

1. Use 'git branch' to see the branches available
	- Usually 'master' and any branch that has been created
2. Use 'git branch newbranchname' to create a new branch
3. Use 'git checkout branchname' to go into that particular branch
4. Make your changes then do 'git status' to see your changes
5. Use 'git add -A" to add all your changes
6. Use 'git commit -m "comment" ' to commit your changes
7. Use 'git push' to add your changes to master 
	Note: may have to use 'git push --set-upstream origin newbranch'
8. Go to git portal (online) and create a pull request
9. Make your necessary comments
10. Have someone review and confirm the merge request
11. Use 'git pull' to see those new changes (make sure you are in master branch) 

Note: steps 1 and 2 are creating new branches
      steps 3-7 are when you are editing your changes and want to merge your changes to master branch
      steps 8-10 are when you confirming merges to master branch
